I am a marine biogeochemist with a background in chemistry, trying to figure out how carbon and nutrient cycles work and how they shape marine ecosystems—and, in the bigger picture, the climate system as a whole. My work blends field sampling, lab analysis, and data-driven modeling to piece together the complex puzzle of ocean biogeochemistry. I understand a bit about how oceans move and a bit about ecosystem modeling, and I enjoy keeping my research diversified. You can find me on the deck of research vessels collecting samples, in the lab wearing my fancy white coat, or at my desk deep into writing and data analysis. Whether at sea, in the lab, or behind a screen, I’m always looking for new ways to connect the dots in marine science.
