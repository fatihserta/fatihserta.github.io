	abstract = {Cold seeps release methane (CH4) from the seafloor to the water column, which fuels microbially mediated aerobic methane oxidation (MOx). Methane-oxidising bacteria (MOB) utilise excess methane, and the MOB biomass serves as a carbon source in the food web. Yet, it remains unclear if and how MOx modifies the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in cold seeps. We investigated MOx rates, DOM compositions and the microbial community during ex-situ incubations of seawater collected from a cold seep site at Norskebanken (north of the Svalbard archipelago) in the Arctic Ocean. Samples were incubated with and without methane amendments. Samples amended with methane (∼1 µM final concentration) showed elevated rates of MOx in both seep and non-seep incubations. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analyses showed that the number of DOM formulas (i.e., molecular diversity) increased by up to 39\% in these incubations. In contrast, the number of formulas decreased by 20\% in samples not amended with methane, both from non-seep and seep locations. DOM composition was thus altered towards a more diverse and heterogeneous composition along with elevated methanotrophic activity in methane-amended conditions. In addition to microbial DOM production, abating microbial diversity indicates that elevated DOM diversity was potentially related to grazing pressure on bacteria. The diversity of DOM constituents, therefore, likely increased with the variety of decaying cells contributing to DOM production. Furthermore, based on a principal coordinate analysis, we show that the final DOM composition of non-seep samples amended with methane became more resemblant to that of seep samples. This suggests that methane intrusions will affect water column DOM dynamics similarly, irrespective of the water column’s methane history.},

Once in the ocean, this DOM is transported together with elements, particles, dissolved gases and biomass along with the neutrally buoyant plume layer. Considering the number and extent of actively venting hydrothermal sites in the oceans, their contribution to the oceanic DOM pool may be substantial. Here, we investigate the dynamics of DOM in relation to hydrothermal venting and related processes at the as yet unexplored Aurora hydrothermal vent field within the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean at 82.9{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} N. We examined the vertical distribution of DOM composition from sea ice to deep waters at six hydrocast stations distal to the active vent and its neutrally buoyant plume layer. In comparison to background seawater, we found that the DOM in waters directly affected by the hydrothermal plume was molecularly less diverse and 5 \%–10 \% lower in number of molecular formulas associated with the molecular categories related to lipid and protein-like compounds. On the other hand, samples that were not directly affected by the plume were chemically more diverse and had a higher percentage of chemical formulas associated with the carbohydrate-like category. Our results suggest that hydrothermal processes at Aurora may influence the DOM distribution in the bathypelagic ocean by spreading more thermally and/or chemically induced compositions, while DOM compositions in epipelagic and mesopelagic layers are mainly governed by the microbial carbon pump dynamics and surface-ocean–sea-ice interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Dissociating gas hydrates, submerged permafrost, and gas bearing sediments release methane to the water column from a multitude of seeps in the Arctic Ocean. The seeping methane dissolves and supports the growth of aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB), but the effect of seepage and seep related biogeochemical processes on water column dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics is not well constrained. We compared dissolved methane, nutrients, chlorophyll, and particulate matter concentrations and methane oxidation (MOx) rates from previously characterized seep and non-seep areas at the continental margin of Svalbard and the Barents Sea in May and June 2017. DOM molecular composition was determined by Electrospray Ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). We found that the chemical diversity of DOM was 3 to 5 \% higher and constituted more protein- and lipid-like composition near methane seeps when compared to non-seep areas. Distributions of nutrients, chlorophyll, and particulate matter however, were essentially governed by the water column hydrography and primary production. We surmise that the organic intermediates directly derived from seepage or indirectly from seep-related biogeochemical processes, e.g. MOx, modifies the composition of DOM leading to distinct DOM molecular-level signatures in the water column at cold seeps.},
