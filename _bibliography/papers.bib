Considering the number and extent of actively venting hydrothermal sites in the oceans, their contribution to the oceanic DOM pool may be substantial.

We examined the vertical distribution of DOM composition from sea ice to deep waters at six hydrocast stations distal to the active vent and its neutrally buoyant plume layer. In comparison to background seawater, we found that the DOM in waters directly affected by the hydrothermal plume was molecularly less diverse and 5 \%–10 \% lower in number of molecular formulas associated with the molecular categories related to lipid and protein-like compounds. On the other hand, samples that were not directly affected by the plume were chemically more diverse and had a higher percentage of chemical formulas associated with the carbohydrate-like category. Our results suggest that hydrothermal processes at Aurora may influence the DOM distribution in the bathypelagic ocean by spreading more thermally and/or chemically induced compositions, while DOM compositions in epipelagic and mesopelagic layers are mainly governed by the microbial carbon pump dynamics and surface-ocean–sea-ice interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We compared dissolved methane, nutrients, chlorophyll, and particulate matter concentrations and methane oxidation (MOx) rates from previously characterized seep and non-seep areas at the continental margin of Svalbard and the Barents Sea in May and June 2017. DOM molecular composition was determined by Electrospray Ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). We found that the chemical diversity of DOM was 3 to 5 \% higher and constituted more protein- and lipid-like composition near methane seeps when compared to non-seep areas. Distributions of nutrients, chlorophyll, and particulate matter however, were essentially governed by the water column hydrography and primary production. We surmise that the organic intermediates directly derived from seepage or indirectly from seep-related biogeochemical processes, e.g. MOx, modifies the composition of DOM leading to distinct DOM molecular-level signatures in the water column at cold seeps.},

In this paper, we present the methods employed for deep-sea ROV operations under drifting ice. We also provide the first description of the Aurora Vent Field, which includes three actively venting black smokers and diffuse flow on the Aurora mound at {\textasciitilde}3,888 m depth on the southern part of the Gakkel Ridge (82.5°N). The biological communities are dominated by a new species of cocculinid limpet, two small gastropods, and a melitid amphipod.

	abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is defined as organic matter that is smaller than a nominal pore size filter (e.g., 0.7 µm) that passes through during the filtration of aquatic samples. It comprises the largest reservoir of reduced carbon (700 Pg C) in the oceans. The DOM pool is in close interaction with all the elemental cycles and food chains in the ocean and is an essential component in the marine microbial loop. 
 
Methane is seeping from numerous geological sources in the Arctic Ocean associated with multiple mechanisms that elevate methane production and release. Independent of the mechanism, however, liberated methane is predominantly consumed in the water column by methanotrophic bacteria (MOB), which use methane as a source of carbon and energy during an aerobic enzymatic reaction called methane oxidation (MOx). In sedimentary fluid flow systems such as cold seeps or hydrothermal vents, the amount of methane release and subsequent MOx would be substantial and further trigger other ecosystem processes such as bacterial growth and heterotrophic consumption and consequent mechanisms that alter DOM composition in the water column.   
 
Since methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and due to its subsequent effect on global warming, it has been quantified extensively in the oceanic environments and its fate in the water column has been investigated in different types of geological settings. However, the effects of methane emanation and methane-driven processes on DOM dynamics in the water column have been merely constrained. The main objective of this thesis was to unravel the modifications of DOM composition in relation to methane release in the Arctic Ocean cold seeps and hydrothermal vents.},

Methane-oxidising bacteria (MOB) utilise excess methane, and the MOB biomass serves as a carbon source in the food web.

We investigated MOx rates, DOM compositions and the microbial community during ex-situ incubations of seawater collected from a cold seep site at Norskebanken (north of the Svalbard archipelago) in the Arctic Ocean. Samples were incubated with and without methane amendments. Samples amended with methane (∼1 µM final concentration) showed elevated rates of MOx in both seep and non-seep incubations. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analyses showed that the number of DOM formulas (i.e., molecular diversity) increased by up to 39\% in these incubations. In contrast, the number of formulas decreased by 20\% in samples not amended with methane, both from non-seep and seep locations. DOM composition was thus altered towards a more diverse and heterogeneous composition along with elevated methanotrophic activity in methane-amended conditions. In addition to microbial DOM production, abating microbial diversity indicates that elevated DOM diversity was potentially related to grazing pressure on bacteria. The diversity of DOM constituents, therefore, likely increased with the variety of decaying cells contributing to DOM production. Furthermore, based on a principal coordinate analysis, we show that the final DOM composition of non-seep samples amended with methane became more resemblant to that of seep samples. This suggests that methane intrusions will affect water column DOM dynamics similarly, irrespective of the water column’s methane history.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the temporal variations in methane concentration and flare activity in the Hola trough (offshore Norway) during May 2018 and June 2022. Between these time periods, methane seep activity exhibits 3.5 times increase, as evidenced by hydroacoustic measurements. As the seep area in the Hola trough is constantly within the hydrate stability zone, the observed increase cannot be attributed to migration of its shallow boundary due to temperature increase. However, a combination of low tide conditions resulting in a lower sediment pore pressure and a bottom water temperature increase resulting in a lower methane solubility is likely to explain the increase in the number of seeps observed in June 2022. The hypothesis of tide influence is supported by data collected from a piezometer deployed and recovered during the cruise showing that the tidal effect was observed 3 m below the seafloor. Despite the numerous methane seeps detected, methane concentration and gas flow rates near the seafloor were low ({\textless}19 nM and {\textless}70 mL min−1, respectively) compared to other areas with methane seep activity. This is likely due to strong currents rapidly dispersing methane in the water column. Sub-seafloor investigations identified pathways for gas migration in methane seep areas, influenced by topography. This study provides valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of methane concentrations, flare activity, and gas distribution in the Hola trough, contributing to our understanding of offshore methane dynamics in the region.},

	abstract = {Cold seeps and cold‐water corals (CWCs) coexist on Northern Norway's continental shelf at the Hola trough between Lofoten and Vesterålen. Here, cold seeps release methane from the seabed, yet none reaches the sea surface. Instead, the methane dissolves and disperses in the ocean where it is ultimately consumed by methane‐oxidizing microorganisms. These microorganisms metabolize methane and release carbon dioxide and dissolved organic matter (DOM), which may impact the biogeochemical habitat of CWCs in close vicinity of cold seeps. We investigated the biogeochemistry of carbon, carbon isotopes, nutrients, DOM compositions, and microbial diversity in the water column. Our results indicated that dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations were 29\% higher near cold seeps with modified carbon's isotopic compositions. The hydrophysical parameters and surface‐to‐bottom control of sinking particles mainly govern water column productivity and nutrient cycle. DOM compositions implied that the seep‐associated microbiomes modify DOM's chemical diversity and isotopic composition at CWCs and the entire water column near cold seeps. Cold seeps and CWCs coexist in Northern Norway's continental shelves; however, enhanced water temperatures and consequent increase in methane release at cold seeps may modify the carbon cycling in the area, which could mitigate the ecological role and functioning of CWC reefs in the future.},
